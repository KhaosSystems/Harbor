# Harbor — The Git Client for Games, Media, and Engineering
Harbor is a Git client built for game development, media production, and asset-heavy pipelines like architectural visualization and engineering (CAD).

Git is the standard for software development, but many studios still rely on proprietary systems like Perforce Helix Core (P4) for production work with large binary assets.

Today, Git has largely caught up. With Git LFS 2.0, file locking, and sparse checkout, it supports the workflows needed for large projects.

The problem now is tooling.

Most Git clients are built for software developers. They don't expose these features well, and they are difficult to adapt to production pipelines, automation, and heavy preflight workflows used in games and media.

Harbor is an attempt to fix that. It's a Git client designed for artists, designers, and technical teams, with better support for asset pipelines, hooks, and heavy automation. 

# Wails (TODO: Reduce/Rewrite)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

2. To run your application in development mode, use the following command:

   ```
   wails3 dev
   ```

   This will start your application and enable hot-reloading for both frontend and backend changes.

3. To build your application for production, use:

   ```
   wails3 build
   ```

   This will create a production-ready executable in the `build` directory.

## Exploring Wails3 Features

Now that you have your project set up, it's time to explore the features that Wails3 offers:

1. **Check out the examples**: The best way to learn is by example. Visit the `examples` directory in the `v3/examples` directory to see various sample applications.

2. **Run an example**: To run any of the examples, navigate to the example's directory and use:

   ```
   go run .
   ```

   Note: Some examples may be under development during the alpha phase.

3. **Explore the documentation**: Visit the [Wails3 documentation](https://v3.wails.io/) for in-depth guides and API references.

4. **Join the community**: Have questions or want to share your progress? Join the [Wails Discord](https://discord.gg/JDdSxwjhGf) or visit the [Wails discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions).

## Project Structure

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with your project structure:

- `frontend/`: Contains your frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- `main.go`: The entry point of your Go backend
- `app.go`: Define your application structure and methods here
- `wails.json`: Configuration file for your Wails project

## Next Steps

1. Modify the frontend in the `frontend/` directory to create your desired UI.
2. Add backend functionality in `main.go`.
3. Use `wails3 dev` to see your changes in real-time.
4. When ready, build your application with `wails3 build`.

Happy coding with Wails3! If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to consult the documentation or reach out to the Wails community.
